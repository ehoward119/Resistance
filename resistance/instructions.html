        <p> In short, there are two teams trying to win: The Stagthenas, and the Sagehens </p>
        <h2> Overall gameplay  </h2>
        <p> Players will have to go on "missions" decide who is coming along with them</p>
        <p> The mission leader will select who goes on what mission. Depending on the stage of 
        the game, there is a different amount of players needed </p>
        <p> Once a mission team is decided upon, players going on the mission will secretely vote to fail or pass the mission </p>
